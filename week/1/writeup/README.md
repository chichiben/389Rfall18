### Part 2 (75 pts)

In this situation, since my job is to audit the firmware for security issues, my first responsibility would be to share the information with my boss. I would also share any initial action items to begin working on the vulnerabilities, and see how my boss receives it and if they feel comfortable sharing how theyâ€™d like to proceed. If after a few weeks I see that there is no change in the release date of the ECU, I would schedule a meeting with my boss and someone else who is responsible for product safety to express my concerns regarding the issues that I found. If they refuse to share any plan of action or make it clear that the release will not be postponed despite the issues still existing, I would consider going public. 

While this ethically seems like the right thing to do in this situation, in order to protect public safety, there would probably be some sort of contingency in my contract with the company restricting me from sharing sensitive information. I would likely have to pick between two unethical choices: going against my word and preventing a potentially public threat. Additionally, if I decide to go public with this information and the company still refuses to postpone the release, there would be even greater threat against the public because the vulnerabilities would be that much more exposed. If I said nothing and made no attempt to follow up with my boss, that would partially be my responsibility since it was my task to find security issues, and I would be an accessory in the situation. Ethically, it seems the best solution would be to tell my boss all of the information and follow up with them; if they ignore the issue, I would probably try to find a contact within the government who is responsible for vehicle inspection, and inform them of the issue.
